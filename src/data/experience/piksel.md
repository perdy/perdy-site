As part of the product-oriented side of this company I'm leading, designing and developing projects related to media metadata with a highly-skilled team. We are end-to-end responsible of a group of services designed for gathering, enriching and exposing different kind of media metadata.

Those services are built using modern tech stacks and designed using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence techniques.

We are backed by an data-driven and polyglot architecture built mainly over Python, Java and JavaScript languages; with multiple databases both relational and NoSQL, highly-scalable serverless services based on streaming engines such as Kafka and AWS Kinesis.
